Apache Commons Math
===================

The Apache Commons Math project is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common practical problems not immediately available in the Java programming language or commons-lang.
This is the fork of [apache commons-math](https://github.com/apache/commons-math). The version number
matches with original. For example, version 3.6.1.2 corresponds to 3.6.1 version of the original. 
The difference is only in simplex method interceptor which is described [here](http://kosbr.github.io/2016/11/07/simplex-interceptor.html)

Documentation
-------------

More information can be found on the [homepage](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math).
The [JavaDoc](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/apidocs) can be browsed.
Questions related to the usage of Apache Commons Math should be posted to the [user mailing list][ml].
